# Signals & Sorcery

`Signals & Sorcery` is an experimental RPG powered by Large Language Models (LLMs).  It has a touch plus natural language hybrid UI. A user chooses an art style and describes a fantasy setting then a map and game assets will be generated accordingly.  From there a player can navigate the map collecting, artifacts, weapons, clues and combating encounter along the way.
